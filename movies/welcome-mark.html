    <p>马克来了 (WELCOME, MARK), 2019, 25 min.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Director - Zach Weintraub</p>
    <p>Starring 贾宁 (Linda Jia) and Mike Lawrence</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Jia Ning, a Beijing fashion photographer, agrees to help translate for Mark, an amateur British journalist coming to China for the first time.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>I lived in Beijing for two years. During that time, I worked as an English teacher and felt like the world of moviemaking that I’d previously lived and breathed was disappearing in the rearview mirror. Fearing an identity crisis, I resolved to shoot something - anything - before going home. WELCOME, MARK was made on an old Hi8 camera by myself and two friends during my final week in China. The film is a testament to some of the nastier foreign attitudes I encountered during my time there, and a tribute to a place and period that I treasure.</p>
