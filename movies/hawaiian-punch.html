    <p>HAWAIIAN PUNCH, 2012, 68 min.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Director/Camera - Nandan Rao</p>
    <p>Sound - Zach Weintraub</p>
    <p>Starring Tor Kristian Anestad and Nicholas Boissonneault</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>A pleasantly experimental, "performed documentary" observing the lives of two Mormon college students spending a semester at the BYU Hawaii campus.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Nandan grew up Mormon, and at 19 spent two years as a missionary in Athens, Greece. During that time, he befriended fellow missionaries Nick and Tor.</p>
    <p>Years later, when the two moved to Oahu for a semester, Nandan went to stay with them for a month and shoot a film reflecting on their gradually shifting attitudes towards life, leisure, and religion.</p>

    <p>A <a class="link" href="https://thenewinquiry.com/short-circuit/" target="#">beautiful article</a> written by Brandon Harris for The New Inquiry that discusses Nandan and I, and this film in particular.</p>
    <p>Video of some <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwQHQR6vh68" target="#">classic Mormon behavior</a> shot the night we all found out how good Nandan is at wrestling.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>TRIVIA: Both of Nandan's feature films (this is the second) include scenes in McDonald's. During the shoot, we had a contest to see who could eat the most expensive McDonald's meal. Nick ate $37 worth of food. More on our general diet during the time <a class="link" href="http://blog.lotlmovie.com/?p=1082" target="#">here</a>.</p>
